# My Statistics Portofolio
###Description
This repo contains some of my statistics-related portofolios when I am studying at Rose-Hulman. Most instructions of those portfolios are created and provided by Dr. Eric Reyes. A detailed report is stored in each project's folder.

##Projects Summary
* Logistic Regression
	* Implement my own logistic regression which returns estimate betas.
	* Predict likelihood of rocket launch failure based on 3 predictors using self-implemented logistic regression(lrm).
* Optimization Simulation
	* Develop best strategy to diagnose people with Ebola in fewest tests.
	* Optimize the number of people should be assigned to each group on the first round of tests through massive simulation.
* Permutation Test
	* Conduct permutation test to answer the question whether the disqualified votes are done on purpose during a law passing process.
	* Test if the disqualified votes' distribution differs from qualified votes'.
* Roc Curve Analysis
	* Analyze possible fingerprint matching false rate through ROC curve.
	* Build an online app for illustration and more app details can be hind [here](https://zhangruinan.shinyapps.io/fp_roc/)
